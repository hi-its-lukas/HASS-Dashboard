# Docker Compose Override - Local Configuration
# =============================================
#
# This file is for local overrides that should NOT be committed to Git.
# Copy this file to docker-compose.override.yml and customize for your setup.
#
# Docker automatically merges docker-compose.override.yml with docker-compose.yml
#
# IMPORTANT: docker-compose.override.yml is in .gitignore - your local
# settings will not be uploaded to the repository.
