You are a senior DevOps + Next.js engineer.

The project currently includes optional HTTPS support via Caddy + Let’s Encrypt
(ACME http-01 / tls-alpn-01 challenges, DOMAIN / ACME_EMAIL env vars, setup script).

We are switching to Cloudflare Tunnel for ALL external HTTPS.
Therefore:
- TLS is terminated by Cloudflare
- No inbound ports 80/443 are reachable
- Let’s Encrypt / ACME MUST be fully removed

TASKS

1) Remove Let's Encrypt / ACME completely
- Remove any Caddy configuration that:
  - enables automatic HTTPS
  - uses ACME (http-01, tls-alpn-01)
  - references ACME_EMAIL or DOMAIN
- Ensure Caddy does NOT attempt to obtain certificates.

2) Simplify Caddy to reverse proxy only (optional)
- Caddy should function only as:
  - optional internal reverse proxy
  - optional HTTP → app proxy
- No TLS requirements inside the container.
- It must work behind Cloudflare Tunnel over plain HTTP.

3) Remove setup logic related to certificates
- Delete or update any setup scripts that:
  - generate `.env` for DOMAIN / ACME_EMAIL
  - mention Let's Encrypt
  - instruct opening ports 80/443
- Remove these references from README and documentation.

4) Docker Compose cleanup
- Remove HTTPS / ACME profiles from docker-compose.yml.
- Ensure `docker compose up -d --build` works with:
  - NO DOMAIN env var
  - NO ACME_EMAIL env var
- Ensure no container crashes when env vars are missing.

5) Cloudflare Tunnel compatibility
- Ensure the app can be accessed via:
  Cloudflare Tunnel → http://localhost:3000
  OR
  Cloudflare Tunnel → http://localhost:80 (if Caddy is kept)
- OAuth redirects must continue to work correctly
  (base URL derived dynamically from request headers).

6) Documentation update
- Update README:
  - Clearly state: "HTTPS is handled by Cloudflare Tunnel"
  - Remove all references to Let's Encrypt and ACME
  - Document recommended Cloudflare Tunnel setup
- Add a short section:
  "Why Let's Encrypt is intentionally not used in this setup"

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT introduce breaking changes to app behavior.
- Do NOT add new infrastructure dependencies.
- Keep changes minimal but correct.
- Do NOT leave dead code or unused configuration behind.

DELIVERABLES
- Cleaned-up Caddyfile (or confirmation it was removed entirely).
- Cleaned-up docker-compose.yml.
- Removed/updated setup scripts.
- Updated README.
- Confirmation that:
  - `docker compose up -d --build` works
  - App runs correctly behind Cloudflare Tunnel without any cert logic
